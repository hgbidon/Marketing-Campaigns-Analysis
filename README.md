# Overview
This project analyzes a marketing A/B testing dataset to compare conversion rates between Ad and PSA groups. Using Python, I performed statistical analysis, created visualizations, and uncovered actionable insights to understand the impact of ad exposure on user behavior.

# Tech Stack
* Python: pandas, numpy, scipy
* Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
* Statistical Analysis: independent t-test

# Key Steps
1. Data Exploration & Cleaning
* Grouped data by test group and ad exposure to compute conversion rates.
* Conducted summary statistics and identified key patterns in the dataset.
2. Statistical Analysis
* Performed independent t-test to compare conversion rates between Ad and PSA groups.
3. Visualization
* Created 4 visualizations: bar chart, histogram, countplot, and heatmap.
* Applied colorblind-friendly palettes to improve accessibility and clarity.
