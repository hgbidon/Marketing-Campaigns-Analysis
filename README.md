# Overview
This project analyzes a [marketing A/B testing dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faviovaz/marketing-ab-testing) to compare conversion rates between Ad and PSA groups. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, I performed statistical analysis, created visualizations, and uncovered actionable insights to understand the impact of ad exposure on user behavior.

# Tech Stack
* Python: pandas, numpy, scipy
* Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
* Statistical Analysis: independent t-test

# Key Steps
1. Data Exploration & Cleaning
* Grouped data by test group and ad exposure to compute conversion rates.
* Conducted summary statistics and identified key patterns in the dataset.
2. Statistical Analysis
* Performed independent t-test to compare conversion rates between Ad and PSA groups.
3. Visualization
* Created 4 visualizations: bar chart, histogram, countplot, and heatmap.
* Applied colorblind-friendly palettes to improve accessibility and clarity.

# Key Takeaways
* Ad exposure and PSA campaigns have measurable differences in conversion rates.
* Peak hours and days for ad engagement were identified.
* Demonstrates ability to perform end-to-end analysis: statistical testing, visualization, and actionable insight extraction.
